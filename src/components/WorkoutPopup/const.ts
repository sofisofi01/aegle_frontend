    title: "Foundational Principles for Any Training Goal",
    text: `Before diving into the specifics of your goals, it's crucial to understand the universal rules that underpin any effective training program. Your first and most important step should always be to consult with a doctor, especially if you have any pre-existing health conditions. Every single workout must begin with a proper warm-up—about 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio and dynamic stretching. This prepares your joints, muscles, and cardiovascular system for the work ahead. Similarly, you should end each session with a cool-down, involving light activity to lower your heart rate and static stretching to improve flexibility and aid recovery.
Never sacrifice proper exercise form for the sake of lifting more weight or doing more repetitions. This is a fundamental principle that will protect you from injury and ensure the target muscles are being worked correctly. Remember that your body is highly adaptive. To keep making progress, you must consistently challenge it through a concept known as "progressive overload." This means you need to gradually make your workouts more difficult. You can do this by increasing the weight you lift, the number of reps or sets you perform, shortening your rest periods, or by advancing to more difficult exercises. Finally, understand that growth happens outside the gym. Muscles repair and become stronger during periods of rest. Prioritizing 7-9 hours of quality sleep and allowing each muscle group 48-72 hours to recover before training it again are non-negotiable components of success.`

    title: "Guidance on Strength Training",
    text: `Strength training focuses on increasing your muscular strength and endurance. Key principles include proper form, progressive overload, and adequate rest between sets (typically 60-90 seconds). Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses should form the foundation of your routine. Start with lighter weights to master technique before increasing load.`

    title: "Guidance on Cardiovascular Training",
    text: `Cardiovascular exercise improves heart health and endurance. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio per week. Include variety: steady-state cardio (running, cycling) for endurance, and HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) for calorie burn and cardiovascular efficiency. Always warm up before and cool down after cardio sessions.`

    title: "How to Properly Select Equipment and Weight",
    text: `Choose weights that allow you to complete your target reps with proper form while still being challenging. If you can easily do more than your target reps, increase the weight. For equipment selection, prioritize safety and functionality. Free weights (dumbbells, barbells) are excellent for compound movements, while machines can help with isolation exercises and are safer for beginners.`

    title: "How to Properly Structure Training Intensity",
    text: `Structure your training intensity using the RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) scale or percentage of your one-rep max. Beginners should start at 60-70% intensity, while advanced trainees can work at 80-90%. Periodize your training by alternating between high-volume/low-intensity and low-volume/high-intensity phases to prevent plateaus and overtraining.`
